<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get automated test in your local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Prerequisites
To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry or a private npm registry, you must install Node.js and the npm command line interface using either a Node version manager or a Node installer.

Note: to download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command:
   ```sh
   npm install -g npm
   ```
*Please refer to the following*
* [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Downloading and installing node js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/veydecapia/cypress-exercise.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages. This downloads dependencies defined in a package.json file and generates a node_modules folder with the installed modules.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
   It would install first the required npm packages.
